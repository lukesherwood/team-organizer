With more and more people trying to avoid Facebook its becoming harder to reach everyone in one place. This application is designed to a simple and social media free place to organize a team 
for a game of sport. Users can freely a create team and a game, invite their friends by sending them a link and users can then sign up to the event with their names and emails.

To further increase utility I aim to implement email notifications for changes to the event i.e. if the event changes time, and also add a way to add a reoccurring event.

Built with Ruby on Rails, Vanilla Javascript and Bootstrap
