#NOTES

##Do Next
chnage html so h4 players and everything else is in its own div, then form is appended to that rather than UL
dom player render is inserting twice after the form
need to stop page refreshing at post player. render to dom without databse and refresh.
.catch errors for fetch requests
drop users event_id column?
fix times display for events
Delete functions for events, teams and user(players)
CSS and styling
buttons say click to close when open?
validations?


##APP TASKS
- A team page for each team
- each team page team information displayed
- each team page has events displayed
- a player can sign up to the team then they can sign up for the event (ideally as one motion)
- the page now displays their name in the event ie 2/10 people attending
- they can remove their name
- forms for creating a team
- forms for creating an event

##Stretch

users can have many teams (will need a join table - user_teams)
add reoccurring events
only show current events
notify players if a new event posted or event they are a part of is changed by creator
comments on events etc
add passwords to users?
